## Description

Gravity is a theme that was designed to be very readable, clean and professional. It is a light color scheme that is very slightly off-white to be easier on the eyes. Syntax elements are easy to read and distinguish, in particular constant values (strings and numbers) stand out in red.

Italics are not used in this theme.

Currently Gravity is GVim only. I tend to use the default colours when in a terminal. If you have a strong desire for added terminal support leave me a comment, drop me an email or even better: send me a patch!

## Install Details

Just drop gravity.vim in to your ~/.vim/colors directory or ~/vimfiles/colors if on Windows.
