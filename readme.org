* Description

Gravity is a theme that was designed to be very readable, clean and
professional. It is a light color scheme that is very slightly
off-white to be easier on the eyes. Syntax elements are easy to read
and distinguish, in particular constant values (strings and numbers)
stand out in red.

Italics are not used in this theme.

Currently Gravity is GVim only. I tend to use the default colours when
in a terminal. If you have a strong desire for added terminal support
leave me a comment, drop me an email or even better: send me a patch!

* Install details

Just drop gravity.vim in to your ~/.vim/colors directory or
~/vimfiles/colors if on Windows.
